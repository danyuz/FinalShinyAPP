#### Context
The Ramen Rater is a product review website for the hardcore ramen enthusiast (or "ramenphile"), with over 2500 reviews to date. This dataset is an export of "The Big List" (of reviews), converted to a CSV format.

#### Content
Each record in the dataset is a single ramen product review. Review numbers are contiguous: more recently reviewed ramen varieties have higher numbers. Brand, Variety (the product name), Country, and Style (Cup? Bowl? Tray?) are pretty self-explanatory. Stars indicate the ramen quality, as assessed by the reviewer, on a 5-point scale; this is the most important column in the dataset!

Note that this dataset does not include the text of the reviews themselves. For that, you should browse through [link](https://www.theramenrater.com/) instead!

#### Inspiration
- What ingredients or flavors are most commonly advertised on ramen package labels?

- How do ramen ratings compare against ratings for other food products (like, say, wine)?

- How is ramen manufacturing internationally distributed?
